# Python Core Concepts Project

This project demonstrates various core concepts of Python programming, including data structures, object-oriented programming, concurrency, error handling, and usage of the standard library. The project is divided into multiple scripts, each focusing on specific topics and features of Python.

## Project Structure

- `advanced_oop.py` - Demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and the use of magic methods.
- `concurrency_examples.py` - Showcases the use of threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio for different types of concurrent operations.
- `exception_handling_advanced.py` - Focuses on advanced error and exception handling techniques including custom exception classes.
- `standard_library_examples.py` - Explores useful modules in the Python Standard Library such as `os`, `sys`, `collections`, and `itertools`.
- `design_patterns.py` - Implements common design patterns in Python including Singleton, Factory Method, and Builder.
- `built_in_functions.py` - Provides examples of Python's built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, `zip`, and `reduce`.

## Key Python Concepts

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects**: Using class definitions and instances.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods that behave differently in subclass contexts.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to methods and variables.
- **Magic Methods**: Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__call__` that enable integration with Python's built-in features.

### Concurrency
- **Threading**: For I/O-bound tasks.
- **Multiprocessing**: For CPU-bound tasks.
- **Asyncio**: For asynchronous programming.

### Error Handling
- **Advanced Exception Handling**: Techniques for managing exceptions more effectively.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating and using custom exception types.

### Standard Library
- **`os` and `sys`**: Interacting with the operating system.
- **`collections`**: Specialized container datatypes.
- **`itertools`**: Functions creating iterators for efficient looping.

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class only has one instance.
- **Factory Method**: Delegates the instantiation of objects to subclasses.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.

### Built-in Functions
- **`map()` and `filter()`**: Transform and filter data respectively.
- **`zip()`**: Aggregates data from two or more iterables.
- **`reduce()`**: Performs cumulative operations on data.
